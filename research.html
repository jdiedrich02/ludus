        <p style="color: white; font-family: 'Roman';">
            We decided to do our own twist on the board game Ludus Latrunculorum. At least that was the inital idea.
            As we moved forward with the project, we decided to add in some extra aspects to the game that led us to
            creating our own version.
        </p>
        <p style="color: white; font-family: 'Roman';">
            This is where we decided to make a text based game that takes a player through a journey as what it was like
            back in 1st century - 2nd century Roman-Britain. This game allows players to carve their own path as a
            person living during
            this time in everyday society. As the player progresses, they will encounter different experiences of what
            is was
            like back in ancient Roman-Britain.
        </p>

        <p style="color: white; font-family: 'Roman';">
            As we improved the research that went into creating this game, we decided to evolve the game loop to include
            much more
            aspects to life back in ancient Roman-Britain. Keep on reading below to read about the designs of these
            aspects in
            our game. We wanted to create a game where people can engage with history in a text based aspect providing a
            different
            experience for people that want to learn about history. Rather then the typical Google search, or reading,
            we wanted to
            make something that people can learn history in a different way and how video games can help people engage
            with history.

        <hr>
        <p style="color: white; font-family: 'Roman';">
            Ludus Latrunculorum is a board game played with small stone tokens on a stone or wooden board consisting of
            a rectangle
            of cells, usually in a pattern such as 6x6, 7x7, 8x8 or other combinations, in this case wooden in a 8x8
            pattern.
            The tokens are divided into two coloured sets, commonly white and black, and all counters are identical in
            function upon
            the board. The two players take turns moving pieces, which may move only in straight lines, which may not be
            diagonal.
            Pieces are captured by being placed between two pieces of the same colour (so white between two black for
            example) but
            again, not on the diagonal. A counter may be blocked from moving when two enemy pieces are adjacent to it,
            an may be
            freed from this by either capture of one of the two offending pieces or a friendly counter being moved into
            “support”
            of it, aka adjacent to the blocked counter.

        <p style="color: white; font-family: 'Roman';">
            In terms of other areas the player can explore, we have added a marketplace that the user can choose to go
            to. We designed
            this around what we could find in terms of what different markets were available to go to back in ancient
            Rome.

            Authors’ Note: As a piece of historical fiction, this work is inherently speculative. Based on available
            archaeological evidence,
            it is a fictional depiction of a potential day in the life of a person in Roman Britain. Though based on
            real locations and research,
            it does NOT represent the (inherently unknowable) reality of the period and should NOT be read as
            historiography.
