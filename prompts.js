        You awaken to the patter of rain and the crackling of fire. Amidst the wind and drizzle are the faint sounds of a dog's whimpers and a periodic shuffling on the roof. You push yourself up in bed, shifting the straw within it, and get to your feet.
        
        The room is cold, pervaded by the rich scent of damp and smoke. This is a quaint but comfortable home, a timber-framed structure around six pedes [feet] wide and eight across, built by your grandfather when your mother was a child. On this end of the house lies two beds-yours and your father's-laid parallel to the hearth, which smoulders silently as it struggles against the rain. The floor is cold and moist, a pallid gray made of clay and gravel (though your father insists he will fire some bricks and replace it any day now) that contrasts the vivid ochre walls. Tallow candles The other half of the house has transformed into little more than storage. Smoked eel and meats hang from the rafters, bags of grain litter the floor, and bundles of drying herbs and fruit rest atop a long empty barrel of wine. The rustle from the roof occurs again.

There is a group of them and there seems to be some betting going on as to whom will win, with money changing hands. Ludus Latrunculorum is a board game played with small stone tokens on a stone or wooden board consisting of a rectangle of cells, usually in a pattern such as 6x6, 7x7, 8x8 or other combinations, in this case wooden in a 8x8 pattern. The tokens are divided into two coloured sets, commonly white and black, and all counters are identical in function upon the board. The two players take turns moving pieces, which may move only in straight lines, which may not be diagonal. Pieces are captured by being placed between two pieces of the same colour (so white between two black for example) but again, not on the diagonal. A counter may be blocked from moving when two enemy pieces are adjacent to it, an may be freed from this by either capture of one of the two offending pieces or a friendly counter being moved into \"support\" of it, aka adjacent to the blocked counter.

You walk along the banks of the river and watch it flow, the rain making its current more aggressive than usual.

Not without a great deal of toil, he cultivates just enough to provide for the entire extended family and pay the annona militaris. Wheat production, as you understand it, is rather complex. He has it transported off somewhere to be milled then returned after processing, meaning the millers also got a cut. To compensate, he also grows peas, beans, and barley. Father continually encourages him to sell the excess, says that we can survive on our own and that our share of wheat should be carted to Londinium for trade; uncle refuses. He's in it for family, not denarii. Besides, your other uncle rears cows and sheep and fishes liberally, making sure to give extra to our hardworking farmer. You find him nodding off by the fire.",

The men, many Rome-born, assist mostly out of kindness and kinship. Uncle once worked at the fort of Vinovia, first as a soldier and later as an overseer of logistics, making sure everyone stayed fed. He learned to read and write in Latin but to this day refuses to chart farm records anywhere other than in his head.
